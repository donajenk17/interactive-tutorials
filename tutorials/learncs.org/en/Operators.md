When doing operations on values and/or variables, we use operators. One example is when we are concatenating strings:

  string main = "I want";
  string food = "pizza.";
  string sentence = main + " " + food; // I want pizza.

In the above example, the plus sign ("+") would be the operator. You can also use operators to perform mathematical equations:

  int num = 2 + 4; // 6
  
### Below are all the operators we would use when performing mathematical operations:

    +          addition                   ex. 2+2 = 4
    -          subtraction                ex. 2-2 = 0
    *          multiplication             ex. 2*2 = 4
    /          division                   ex. 2/2 = 1
    %          modulus                  ex. 2%2 = 0
    ++         increment(adds by 1)       ex. n++
    --         decrement(subtracts by 1)  ex. n--
    
### The Modulus

The modulus is the remainder of one number when divided by another number.

    int num1 = 4;
    int num2 = 3;
    int num = 4 % 3; // 1
